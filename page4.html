                     <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; World War II not only marks by its large-scale brutality, but also sees the newly emerged combat techniques that do not exist before. As World War I is noticeable for its tank and trench warfare, World War II sees the increasing popularity of planes as combat weapons that few decades before people do not pay attention to. During this time, a new military tactic utilizes planes emerge- Strategic Bombing. Encyclopaedia Britannica defines: “[strategic bombing is an] approach to aerial bombardment designed to destroy a country’s ability to wage war by demoralizing civilians and targeting features of an enemy’s infrastructure—such as factories, railways, and refineries—that are essential for the production and supply of war materials. Some definitions of strategic bombing, however, also include roles for supporting ground troops in combat operations. Strategic bombing is a facet of total war, the enlistment of a society’s entire resources to aid in a conflict”.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aerial missions do not start with such a crucial role in the military, in fact, most of the people, even military personnel believe that planes are nothing more than novelties, and their impacts are way beneath what the Navy can achieve. Their doubts are justifiable, since in the beginning, planes are nothing more than a few wooden sticks paste together; they are fragile and unstable: “At the dawn of World War I, planes were still manufactured from flimsy wood and easily ripped canvas. The pilot and passenger sat, with goggles, leather helmet, and seat belt, out in the open air, and flew with engines about as powerful as a lawnmower’s. The controls were basic and simple: a stabilizer, a stick, a rudder, a throttle, and a spark control. You just got in and flew” (Bradley 41). Pilots at the time usually perform acrobatics and tricks in small towns and deliver mails for the post offices. No one at the time will believe planes later become major weapons that shape the course of the war.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despite planes’ fragility, their military functions come into use very soon in Europe. In 1911, Italy becomes the first country to use planes to attack cities. It designs bi-plane and drops bombs in Tunisia and Tripoli in the final stage of Africa colonization. The results are highly ineffective (Hopkins 4-5). However, this does not slow down the usages of planes as military weapons in Europe. In fact, World War I sees the increase usages of aircraft in the European theatre. Germany becomes the first country to target civilian cities by bombing eastern England in 1915, known as the German zeppelin Raids, which decreases Britain's morale greatly at the time. In response, Britain creates the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1918 (5). The Royal Air Force is the first independent air force in the world. Major General Hugh Trenchard “Father of RAF” is one of the most important figures in RAF history and the first few advocates for strategic bombing. Trenchard believes that air and ground units need to work together to achieve maximum destructions. Also, it is important to destroy vital elements of the enemies, mainly the supply lines and the railways. In addition, he also believes that destroying industrial targets such as chemical plants and coal mines will effectively paralyze the enemies (6).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
